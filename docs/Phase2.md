## 🧪 Test Cases

### Multi-Agent Coordination Tests
```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_spawn_multiple_agents():
    """Test spawning multiple specialized agents"""
    registry = AgentRegistry()
    
    # Spawn frontend agent
    frontend_config = AgentConfig(
        agent_type=AgentType.AIDER_FRONTEND,
        name="frontend",
        workspace_path=Path("."),
        focus_areas=["components", "styling"]
    )
    frontend_session = await registry.spawn_agent(frontend_config)
    
    # Spawn backend agent
    backend_config = AgentConfig(
        agent_type=AgentType.AIDER_BACKEND,
        name="backend", 
        workspace_path=Path("."),
        focus_areas=["api", "database"]
    )
    backend_session = await registry.spawn_agent(backend_config)
    
    assert frontend_session.status == "active"
    assert backend_session.status == "active"
    assert len(registry.active_sessions) == 2

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_command_routing():
    """Test intelligent command routing"""
    router = CommandRouter(mock_registry, mock_project_structure)
    
    # Test frontend routing
    plan = await router.route_command("fix the login form styling")
    assert any("frontend" in agent.focus_areas for agent in plan.selected_agents)
    
    # Test backend routing  
    plan = await router.route_command("add authentication to the API")
    assert any("backend" in agent.focus_areas for agent in plan.selected_agents)
    
    # Test coordination routing
    plan = await router.route_command("add user profiles across the entire app")
    assert len(plan.selected_agents) > 1

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_claude_code_integration():
    """Test Claude Code for reasoning tasks"""
    claude_agent = ClaudeCodeAgent(claude_config, shared_memory)
    await claude_agent.start()
    
    debug_task = Task(
        command="debug the race condition in user authentication",
        intent=TaskIntent(
            task_type=TaskType.DEBUG,
            complexity_score=0.8,
            requires_reasoning=True
        )
    )
    
    result = await claude_agent.execute_task(debug_task)
    assert result.status == "completed"
    assert "race condition" in result.output.lower()
```

### Conflict Detection Tests
```python
def test_file_conflict_detection():
    """Test detection of file conflicts between agents"""
    coordination_engine = CoordinationEngine(registry, shared_memory)
    
    task1 = Task(
        command="modify login.js authentication logic",
        assigned_agents=["frontend-agent"]
    )
    task2 = Task(
        command="refactor login.js error handling", 
        assigned_agents=["backend-agent"]
    )
    
    conflicts = coordination_engine._detect_conflicts([task1, task2])
    
    assert len(conflicts) == 1
    assert conflicts[0].conflict_type == "file_conflict"
    assert "login.js" in [str(f) for f in conflicts[0].affected_files]
```

## 🎯 Phase 2 Demo Script

After completion, this workflow should work:

```bash
# Initialize with multiple agents
cd my-fullstack-app
agentic init
# Output: ✅ Configured frontend, backend, and testing agents

# Execute coordinated command  
agentic "add user profile feature with avatar upload"
# Output:
# 🤖 Analyzing command... requires frontend + backend coordination
# [Backend Agent]: Creating user profile API endpoints...
# [Frontend Agent]: Building profile UI components...
# [Testing Agent]: Writing profile feature tests...
# ✅ User profile feature implemented across stack

# Execute debugging command
agentic "debug the slow API response on user login"
# Output: 
# 🧠 Routing to reasoning agent for analysis...
# [Claude Code]: Analyzing authentication flow...
# [Claude Code]: Found N+1 query issue in user permissions...
# [Backend Agent]: Implementing fix with eager loading...
# ✅ Login performance improved by 80%

# Check agent status
agentic status
# Output:
# 🟢 Frontend Agent: Active (React specialist)
# 🟢 Backend Agent: Active (Node.js API specialist)  
# 🟢 Testing Agent: Active (Jest/Cypress specialist)
# 🧠 Reasoning Agent: Active (Claude Code)
```
