# ML Model Specifications for Automated Trading System

## 1. Introduction

This document provides specifications for the core machine learning models used within the automated trading system. Each specification outlines the model's purpose, inputs, outputs, potential algorithms, evaluation metrics, and retraining/adaptation strategies.

## 2. Core Model Types

### 2.1. Market Prediction Models

These models aim to predict future market characteristics. Multiple specialized models might exist.

#### 2.1.1. Price/Directional Movement Prediction Model

*   **Purpose:** Predict the likely direction (e.g., up, down, neutral) or magnitude of price movement for a given trading instrument over a specific future horizon (e.g., next N minutes, hours, or days).
*   **Inputs (Features):**
    *   Historical price/volume data (OHLCV).
    *   Technical indicators (e.g., Moving Averages, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands).
    *   Market microstructure features (e.g., order book imbalance, bid-ask spread).
    *   Volatility measures.
    *   Inter-market correlations.
    *   Alternative data (e.g., sentiment scores from news/social media, economic indicators).
*   **Outputs:**
    *   Categorical: Up, Down, Neutral.
    *   Probabilistic: Probability for each class.
    *   Regression: Predicted price change or target price.
*   **Potential Algorithms:**
    *   Time Series Models: ARIMA, GARCH.
    *   Deep Learning: LSTMs, GRUs, Transformers, Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs).
    *   Gradient Boosting Machines: XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost.
    *   Support Vector Machines (SVMs).
    *   Ensemble methods.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC-ROC, Log-loss.
    *   Regression: MAE, MSE, RMSE, R-squared.
    *   Financial: Hit rate (correct direction), backtesting P&L based on signals.
*   **Retraining Strategy:**
    *   Scheduled retraining (e.g., daily, weekly) using new data.
    *   Triggered retraining based on:
        *   Concept drift detection (e.g., significant drop in predictive accuracy).
        *   Major market regime changes.
    *   Online learning capabilities for certain model types to adapt more rapidly.

#### 2.1.2. Volatility Prediction Model

*   **Purpose:** Predict the future volatility of a trading instrument, which is crucial for risk management, position sizing, and options pricing (if applicable).
*   **Inputs (Features):**
    *   Historical price data.
    *   Realized volatility measures (e.g., Garman-Klass).
    *   Implied volatility (if options data is available).
    *   GARCH model residuals.
    *   Macroeconomic event indicators.
*   **Outputs:**
    *   Predicted volatility value (e.g., standard deviation of returns) for a future period.
*   **Potential Algorithms:**
    *   Econometric Models: GARCH, EGARCH, GJR-GARCH.
    *   Machine Learning: LSTMs, GRUs, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   MSE, MAE, RMSE against realized volatility.
    *   Q-Risk (quantile loss).
*   **Retraining Strategy:** Similar to price prediction models, with frequent updates due to the nature of volatility.

### 2.2. Reinforcement Learning (RL) Agent for Strategy Optimization

*   **Purpose:** To learn and execute an optimal trading strategy by directly interacting with the market environment (simulated or live) to maximize a cumulative reward function. This agent embodies the "self-learning" aspect of the system.
*   **State Space (S):** A representation of the market environment and agent's status. Examples:
    *   Current market price data (e.g., recent OHLCV, order book snapshots).
    *   Technical indicators.
    *   Predictions from Market Prediction Models (see 2.1).
    *   Current portfolio holdings, P&L.
    *   Available capital.
    *   Time-based features (e.g., time of day, day of week).
    *   Market regime indicators.
*   **Action Space (A):** The set of possible trading actions the agent can take. Examples:
    *   Discrete: Buy, Sell, Hold.
    *   Multi-discrete: Buy X units, Sell Y units, Hold.
    *   Continuous: Percentage of capital to allocate to a long/short position.
    *   Position Sizing: Determine the size of the trade.
*   **Reward Function (R):** A scalar value that guides the agent's learning. Must be carefully designed to reflect desired trading outcomes. Examples:
    *   Realized P&L per step or episode.
    *   Risk-adjusted return (e.g., Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio).
    *   Penalties for excessive transaction costs, high drawdown, or violating risk limits.
    *   Bonus for achieving certain profit targets or maintaining stability.
*   **Potential Algorithms:**
    *   Value-based: Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and its variants (Double DQN, Dueling DQN).
    *   Policy-based: REINFORCE, A2C (Advantage Actor-Critic), A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic).
    *   Actor-Critic: PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization), DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient), SAC (Soft Actor-Critic).
*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   Cumulative reward over episodes.
    *   Standard trading performance metrics from backtesting/live trading: Total P&L, Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, Max Drawdown, Win Rate, Average Win/Loss.
    *   Stability of the learned policy.
    *   Exploration efficiency.
*   **Adaptation Strategy:**
    *   Continuous learning in an online fashion if feasible and safe.
    *   Periodic retraining/fine-tuning of the policy using new market data and experiences.
    *   The reward function itself might be subject to review and adjustment based on overall system goals.
    *   Exploration strategies (e.g., epsilon-greedy, noise injection) to adapt to new market dynamics.

### 2.3. Risk Assessment Models (Optional, can be part of RL state or separate)

*   **Purpose:** To quantify various aspects of risk associated with potential trades or current portfolio.
*   **Inputs (Features):**
    *   Portfolio composition.
    *   Market volatility (from Volatility Prediction Model or other sources).
    *   Correlation matrices between assets.
    *   Liquidity measures.
*   **Outputs:**
    *   Value at Risk (VaR).
    *   Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) / Expected Shortfall.
    *   Maximum drawdown estimates.
    *   Liquidity risk scores.
*   **Potential Algorithms:**
    *   Historical simulation.
    *   Monte Carlo simulation.
    *   Parametric models (e.g., variance-covariance method).
    *   Machine learning models to predict tail risk.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   Accuracy of VaR/CVaR backtesting (e.g., number of breaches).
*   **Retraining Strategy:** Regular updates with new market data to reflect current risk profiles.

## 3. Model Management and Governance

*   **Versioning:** All models, their training data, and configurations will be versioned.
*   **Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring of model performance in production.
*   **Explainability:** Efforts to understand model decisions where possible (e.g., using SHAP, LIME for predictive models).
*   **Bias Detection:** Regular checks for biases in models or data that could lead to unfair or suboptimal outcomes.
*   **Rollback:** Mechanisms to quickly roll back to a previous stable model version if a new version underperforms or causes issues.

These specifications provide a starting point. As the system evolves, new models may be introduced, and existing ones refined. The focus remains on creating a robust, adaptive, and profitable trading system.
