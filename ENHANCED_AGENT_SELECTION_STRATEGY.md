# Enhanced Agent Selection Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines our sophisticated agent selection strategy that leverages the unique strengths of both Claude Code and Aider, ensuring optimal tool utilization for different task types.

## 🎯 Core Selection Principles

### **Claude Code - Fast & Creative**
**Best for:**
- ✨ Quick analysis and explanations
- 🔍 Single-file debugging and review
- 💡 Creative problem-solving suggestions
- ⚡ Fast performance optimization insights
- 🧠 Understanding complex algorithms
- 🏗️ Architectural recommendations
- 📊 Code quality assessments

### **Aider - Systematic & Thorough**
**Best for:**
- 🏗️ Multi-file implementations
- 🔄 Systematic refactoring projects
- 🎯 Building complete features end-to-end
- 🧪 Test suite creation and maintenance
- 🏛️ Large-scale architectural changes
- 📁 Coordinated file modifications
- 📋 Methodical, step-by-step development

## 🧠 Intelligent Selection Algorithm

### **Scoring Factors**

#### 1. **Task Type Recognition**
```
Claude Code Triggers (+5 points):
- explain, analyze, review, debug
- what does, how does, why does
- understand, summarize, describe
- examine, inspect, evaluate

Aider Triggers (+3 points):
- create system, build, implement feature
- refactor, migrate, add tests
- develop, construct, establish
```

#### 2. **Scope Detection**
```
Single File (Claude +2 points):
- file, function, class, method
- in models.py, in config.py
- specific implementation

Multi File (Aider +2 points):
- system, module, application
- multiple files, entire project
- models and services
```

#### 3. **Approach Requirements**
```
Creative (Claude +2 points):
- creative, innovative, alternative
- better way, optimize, improve
- ideas, ways to enhance

Systematic (Aider +1 point):
- step by step, thorough, comprehensive
- methodical, structured approach
```

#### 4. **Pattern-Based Routing**
```
Explanation Patterns (Claude +4 points):
- "explain the", "what is", "how does"
- "analyze the", "review the"

Creation Patterns (Aider +4 points):
- "create a", "build a", "implement a"
- "develop a", "set up", "establish"
```

## 🔧 Advanced CLI Features Integration

### **Claude Code Enhancements**
```bash
# Print mode for immediate results
claude -p "explain this function"

# JSON output for structured data
claude --output-format json "analyze architecture"

# Verbose logging for insights
claude --verbose "debug performance issue"
```

### **Aider Enhancements**
```bash
# Smart file targeting
aider --files src/models.py src/services.py

# Multi-model configuration
aider --model gemini/gemini-2.0-flash-exp

# Specialized prompts
aider --architect "design authentication system"
```

## 🎨 Model Selection Strategy

### **Claude Sonnet** 
- **Use for:** Fast, creative analysis and quick implementations

- **Advantage:** Speed + Creativity

### **Gemini Pro 2.5 Experimental**
- **Use for:** Detailed reasoning and systematic problem-solving
- **Optimal tasks:** Complex multi-file implementations, thorough analysis
- **Advantage:** Methodical + Comprehensive

### **Task Duration Considerations**
- **< 15 minutes:** Claude Code (quick insights)
- **> 15 minutes:** Aider (extended sessions)
- **Complex builds:** Aider + Gemini (systematic approach)

## 🎯 Specialized Agent Types

### **Frontend Specialization**
```
Triggers: react, frontend, ui, component, css, html
Agent: AIDER_FRONTEND
Focus: UI components, styling, user experience
```

### **Testing Specialization**
```
Triggers: test, testing, unittest, pytest, spec
Agent: AIDER_TESTING
Focus: Test automation, TDD, quality assurance
```

### **Backend Specialization**
```
Triggers: api, database, server, backend, auth
Agent: AIDER_BACKEND
Focus: Business logic, data models, system architecture
```
