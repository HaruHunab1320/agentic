# For system tests, you'd typically interact with the system as a whole,
# possibly through its API, command-line interface, or by simulating external events.
# These tests are broader and might require a fully deployed (or near-production) environment.

# Example: Simulate a full trading day or a specific trading scenario.
# This often involves setting up initial conditions, triggering events,
# and then verifying the outcomes (e.g., trades executed, P&L, system state).

@pytest.mark.skip(reason="System tests require a running system environment, skipping for now.")

    An example system test (end-to-end test).

    # 1. Setup:
    #    - Ensure the trading system is running (or simulate its components).
    #    - Initialize market conditions (e.g., mock market data feed).
    #    - Set up accounts, initial capital, etc.

    # 2. Action:
    #    - Simulate market data updates.
    #    - Let the system run its strategy and make trading decisions.
    #    - Simulate order execution through a mock broker.

    # 3. Verification:
    #    - Check if expected trades were placed.
    #    - Verify account balances and P&L.
    #    - Check system logs for errors or specific events.
    #    - Ensure ML models adapted if that's part of the scenario.

    assert True # Replace with actual assertions based on the scenario.
    # Example assertions:
    # assert get_portfolio_value() > initial_portfolio_value
    # assert "BUY_ORDER_FILLED" in get_system_logs()

# System tests for ML strategy optimization would be particularly complex,
# involving scenarios where the system is expected to learn and adapt.
# For example:
# - Present the system with a market trend it hasn't seen.
# - Verify that after a period, its trading strategy adjusts.
# - Check that backtesting results for the new strategy are consistent.
