# Swarm Monitor Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Agent Initialization Error
**Problem**: Agents were failing to start with "Agent not found in registry" error
**Root Cause**: When agent spawning failed (e.g., due to authentication issues), the session was still returned but the agent wasn't registered
**Fix**: 
- Added check for session status after spawning to ensure agent started successfully
- Added better error handling and logging in coordination engine

### 2. Claude Code Authentication in Automated Mode
**Problem**: Claude Code was hanging waiting for browser authentication in automated execution
**Root Cause**: Interactive authentication prompts were blocking execution
**Fix**:
- Added `AGENTIC_AUTOMATED_MODE` environment variable check
- In automated mode, fail fast with clear error message instead of waiting for user input
- Handle both "needs_browser_auth" and "needs_setup" cases

### 3. Missing Monitor Methods
**Problem**: Agents were calling methods that didn't exist in enhanced monitor (update_task_progress, start_task)
**Root Cause**: Enhanced monitor has different API than basic monitor
**Fix**:
- Updated orchestrator to check for method existence and use appropriate method
- Removed direct calls to update_task_progress (enhanced monitor calculates automatically)
- Added compatibility layer for start_task vs start_agent_task

### 4. Enhanced Debug Logging
**Added**:
- More detailed logging when agents fail to spawn
- Registry state logging when agent not found
- Session status logging for debugging

## How the Swarm Monitor Works Now

1. **Single Agent Execution**: Monitor displays even for single agent tasks
2. **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Grid layout shows all agents working in parallel
3. **Real-time Updates**: Shows current activity, progress, and status
4. **Task-based Progress**: Progress calculated from task completion, not time
5. **Activity Streaming**: Real-time display of what agents are doing

## Testing

Run these scripts to verify the fixes:

```bash
# Test basic coordination
python test_coordination_fix.py

# Test single agent with monitor display
python test_single_agent_monitor.py

# Test monitor display with longer task
python test_monitor_display.py
```

## Environment Setup

For automated/CI execution, set:
```bash
export AGENTIC_AUTOMATED_MODE=true
```

This will:
- Skip interactive authentication prompts
- Fail fast with clear error messages
- Prevent hanging on user input

## Next Steps

1. Ensure Claude Code is authenticated before running tests:
   ```bash
   claude --version  # Should complete without prompts
   ```

2. For multi-agent tasks, the monitor will show a grid layout with all agents

3. Monitor automatically starts/stops with task execution
